# Chapter 24

- Parser combinators
    - Parsing: accept serialized input (characters or bytes), and turn it into a
      syntax representation (possibly tree-like)

- A few more words of introduction
    - This chapter covers only what you need; may not be long enough for making
      your own parser (like I want to make a parser).

- Understanding the parsing process
