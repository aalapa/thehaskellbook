# Chapter 5

- Types

- You cannot create untyped data in Haskell

- Typed lambda calculus (System F) in the 1970s
    - Haskell improves upon System F
        - Allows general recursion
        - Hindley-Milner type system

- Type systems in logic / mathematics designed to impose constraints that
  enforce correctness.
- Well-designed type systems help eliminate some classes of errors
- Also restructure concerns such as what a conditional over a non-Boolean value
  might be
- Type system defines associations between different parts of a program
- Checks all parts fit together in logically consistent, provably correct way.

- Haskell applies static typing, which means type-checking occurs at compile
  time.
