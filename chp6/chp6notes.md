# Chapter 6

- Typeclasses

- Kind of the opposite of types
    - Type declarations define how types are created
    - Typeclasses define how set of types are consumed or used.

- You should be able to add new cases and new functions to a data type without
  recompilation and retain static type safety (e.g. no type casting)

- Type classes are like interfaces to data
