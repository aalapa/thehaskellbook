# Chapter 8

- Recursion: self-referential expressions

- Important because it allows us to define something indefinite, or incremental
  computation without having to duplicate source code.

- On the surface, lambda calculus doesn't seem to have a notion for recursion.
    - Being able to write recursive functions is essential to Turing completeness
        - Turing completeness: Can simulate a Turing machine (have some data
          representation, and some operations like reading, editing (writing or
          nullifying), and moving the tape)
    - Y combinator, or fixed point combinator, helps write recursive functions
      in the lambda syntax.

- Factorial

```haskell
Prelude> :{
Prelude| fourFactorial :: Integer
-- Only handles one exact case of factorial. impractical.
Prelude| fourFactorial = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
Prelude| :}
Prelude> :{
Prelude| brokenFact1 :: Integer -> Integer
-- Broken, never stops because there's never a base case.
Prelude| brokenFact1 n = n * brokenFact1 (n - 1)
Prelude| :}
Prelude> :{
Prelude| factorial :: Integer -> Integer
-- Success, because now we have a base case at 0.
Prelude| factorial 0 = 1
Prelude| factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
Prelude| :}
Prelude> factorial 4
24
Prelude>
```

- Another way to look at recursion
    - Function composition (taking a function and passing it into another
      function) is like recursion (except recursion enforces that the same
      function gets passed around)
    - Function composition is definite, while recursion is indefinite.
    - A programming language built on top of lambda calculus has one verb for
      expressing computations that can b evaluated: *apply*. Everything else is
      pretty much syntactic sugar.

```haskell
Prelude> :{
-- Prelude> incTimes 10 0
-- 10
-- Prelude> incTimes 5 0
-- 5
-- Prelude> incTimes 5 5
-- 10
Prelude| incTimes :: (Eq a, Num a) => a -> a -> a
Prelude| incTimes 0 n = n
-- `times` is variable denoting number of times to call method.
Prelude| incTimes times n = 1 + (incTimes (times - 1) n)
Prelude| :}
Prelude> :{
Prelude| applyTimes :: (Eq a, Num a) => a -> (b -> b) -> b -> b
Prelude| applyTimes 0 f b = b
Prelude| applyTimes n f b = f (applyTimes (n - 1) f b)
-- Prelude> incTimes' 0 10
-- 10
-- Prelude> incTimes' 10 0
-- 10
-- Prelude> incTimes' 5 5
-- 10
Prelude| incTimes' :: (Eq a, Num a) => a -> a -> a
Prelude| incTimes' times n = applyTimes times (+1) n
Prelude| :}

- Bottom
    - Refers to computations that do not successfully result in a value.
    - Denoted by `(âŠ¥)`.
    - Mostly failed with error, or failed to terminate.
    - In logic, corresponds to False.

```haskell
Prelude> :{
Prelude| f :: Bool -> Int
-- Calling `True` returns in an exception, which is an example of `bottom`.
Prelude| f True = error "blah"
-- Calling `False` doesn't result in a bottom value.
